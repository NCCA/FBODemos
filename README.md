#Using Framebuffer Objects
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/FBO.png)

A number of demos showing how to use Frame buffer objects, including real time shadows and render to FBO demos

Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
